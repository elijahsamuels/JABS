― Stan Lee quotes
“Face front, true believers!”
“With great power comes great responsibility.”
“Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.”
“Excelsior!”
“There is only one who is all powerful, and his greatest weapon is love.”
“And now, until we meet again, may the blessings of Asgard be showered upon you!”
“With great power, comes great responsibility.”
“That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero”

“Welcome true believers, this is Stan Lee. We’re about to embark the exploration of a fantastic new universe and the best part is that you are gonna create it with me. You may know me as a storyteller, but hey on this journey consider me your guide. I provide the widy and wonderful worlds and you create the sights, sounds and adventures. All you need to take part is your brain. So take a listen and think big, no bigger, we make it an epic. Remember when I created characters like the Fantastic Four and the X-Men? We were fascinated by science and awed by the mysteries of the great beyond. Today we consider a nearer deeper unknown one inside ourselves. […] we asked: What is more real? A world that we are born into or the one we create ourselves. As we begin this story, we find humanity lost within is own techno bubble. With each citizen the star of their own digital fantasy. […] But the real conundrum is, just because we have the ability to recreated ourselves, should we? […] Excelsior!” ”
